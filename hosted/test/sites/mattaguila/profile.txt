profile=<u><a href="http://mattaguila.com/hosted/resume.pdf">Resume</a></u><br><br>I received my Bachelors of Arts in Visual Communications in <br>September, 2006 from Brooks Institute of Photography located in Ventura, CA. This was a result of extreme commitment and devotion <br>to my three year, year-round schooling. I decided to depart from <br>Southern California and I am now relocated back in the Pacific Northwest. I currently work for one of the fastest growing online education interactive marketing companies in downtown Seattle, WA.
